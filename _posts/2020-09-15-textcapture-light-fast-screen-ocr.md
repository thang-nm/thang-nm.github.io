TextCapture is a light and fast OCR app that I made to simplify the text capturing on the screen for macOS. \
TextCapture uses Google Vision API, so it has high precision.

## No face, but always on your menubar.

To use TextCapture, you just need click on the menu bar icon, then drag the area you want to detect. \
After it captured, a mini toast will be showed on bottom of screen, and the detected text will be copied to the clipboard. Now you can paste (`‚åò` + `V`) anywhere you want.

If you miss this toast, you can see the status bar icon.
- `‚úî` means text be captured.
- `ùóà` means captured nothing.
- `êÑÇ` means it got error. Something went wrong. You may need to retry!

## Download
You can download from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5g3hqjy0500ya6w/TextCapture-0.0.1.app.zip?dl=0).

## Supported languages
Many! You can find [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/languages#supported-langs).

## Before you capture

You may need to grant permission to take screenshot. Need help, see [this](https://support.hubstaff.com/how-to-give-hubstaff-screen-capture-permissions-on-macos-catalina/).

## Question & Answer
**Q** &#8211; Is it free or not? \
**A** &#8211; It's currently fee.

**Q** &#8211; Is there a version for Windows or Linux? \
**A** &#8211; Maybe or not! I don't know.

**Q** &#8211; Will there be more features in the future? \
**A** &#8211; Yes, certainly! Now it's a just a minimal version.


## Important Thing
TextCapture uses Google Vision API (it's not free) so I don't know how long it can live. But I will try to make it last as long as I can.
