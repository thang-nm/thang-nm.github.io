I made an app that helps you activate some apps for macOS. \
Hope you guy like it!

## Download
You can download app here: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f5ik5ib2k0y832b/XApps-0.0.1.app.zip?dl=0).
Lastest version: `0.0.1` (14 apps)

## How to use
This app doesn't have any signature, so you need to do [`this`]() to launch this app.
Don't worry about it, because it's very safe.


## Supported apps
You can figure out after you launch this app and see in `Supported apps` menu.

## Two types of activation

#### `Almost Done`

That means you need to register with your email and random license.
License key is maybe a long enough string of random character, or like sample format, or md5 hash of somethings, ...
You can try until you get activated.

Almost all app with this type, you can feel free to update and dont need to reactive. Because your app has a license.

#### `Done`

You can use app now without do anything. But.. when you got an app update, you need to reactive.

## Note for both type

Version in `Supported apps` menu is the latest it work with, but you can try with the new one. \
If the new update has the same way to active with the older, XApps still can activate it.
