I made a tool that helps you activate some apps for macOS. Hope you guy like it!

## Download

Latest version: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lkp1efbs2svcw92/AAAjl7DxAqfPlsdI72Nlj0iVa?dl=0).

## How to launch

This app doesn't have any signature, so you need to do [this](https://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper) to launch this app.
Don't worry about it, because it's safe. And you know that you need to do this to run other ked apps!

## Supported apps

You can figure out supported app in `Supported apps` menu after you launch this app.

## Two types of activation

### `Almost Done`

That means you need to register with your email and random license key.
License key is maybe a long enough string of random characters, like sample format, or hash of something, ...
You can try to activate until you get activated state.

Mayny apps with this type, you can feel free to update and don't need to reactivate. Because it kept the license info and didn't check again. But others did not.

### `Done`

You can use the app right now without do anything. But.. when you get a new version, you need to reactivate.

## Note for both type

Version in `Supported apps` menu is the latest version I work with, but you can try with the new one. If the new version has the same mechanical, XApps still can activate it.

If it's helpful for you, you can [buy me a ![coffee](/assets/img/coffee.svg)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thangnm){:.buy-me-a-coffee}.
